Extensions.js Reference
=======================

Illuminator extends many of the UIAElement types provided by [Apple's UIAutomation system](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/UIAutomationRef/_index.html).



General Purpose Functions Reference
-----------------------------------

#### `target()`
Returns a fresh reference to `UIATarget.localTarget()`.

#### `mainWindow()`
Returns a fresh reference to `UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().mainWindow()`.

#### `host()`
Returns a fresh reference to `UIATarget.localTarget().host()`.

#### `delay()`
Shortcut to `UIATarget.localTarget().delay()`.

#### `getTime()`
Returns the number of seconds (with decimal milliseconds) since Jan 1st, 1970.

#### `isNotNilElement(elem)`
Returns `true` if the given element is a valid non-nil `UIAElement`.

#### `isHardSelector(selector)`
Returns `true` if the given selector is a lookup function or string -- returning at most only one element.

#### `newUIAElementNil()`
Returns what you'd expect `new UIAElementNil()` to return, since it doesn't.

#### `decodeStackTrace(err)`
Returns an object describing the stack information contained in the caught error object `err`.  The fields in the return value are as follows:

* `isOK`: boolean, whether any errors at all were encountered
* `message`: string describing any error encountered
* `errorName`: string name of the error
* `stack`: an array of trace objects in the order that represents the stack

The objects in the `stack` array have fields as follows:

* `functionName`: string name of function, or undefined if the function was anonymous
* `nativeCode`: boolean whether the function was defined in UIAutomation binary code
* `file`: if not native code, the basename of the file containing the function
* `line`: if not native code, the line where the function is defined
* `column`: if not native code, the column where the function is defined


#### `getStackTrace()`
Return the current stack trace (minus this function itself) at any point in code.  The return value is the same format as the `stack` field from `decodeStackTrace()`

#### `__file__()`
Return the file containing this line.

#### `__function__()`
Return the name of the function containing this line.




Exceptions Reference
--------------------

The following exceptions are predefined in Illuminator:

#### `IlluminatorSetupException(message)`
This exception indicates problems caused by improper setup of Illuminator: installation of ruby libraries, improper arguments passed to functions, etc.

#### `IlluminatorRuntimeFailureException(message)`
This exeception indicates an unexpected condition in the automation environment; the failure to accomplish something that expected to succeed.

#### `IlluminatorRuntimeVerificationException(message)`
This exception indicates a failed assertion in the state of the automation -- an improper value at a specific (known) checkpoint.


Exception Class Creation Reference
----------------------------------

#### `makeErrorClass(className)`
Create (return) an error constructor function to produce exception objects with the given class name.  The constructor function will accept `message` as its only argument.

#### `makeErrorClassWithGlobalLocator(fileName, className)`
Create (return) an error constructor function to produce exception objects with the given class name.  The constructor function will accept `message` as its only argument, and the message will be prepended with the filename, line number and column number of the place from which the error originated.  This function is meant to create error classes that will be caught by the global error handler (which is unable to produce stack traces) so that the probable location of the faulty lines can be reported.


Input Methods Reference
-----------------------

Illuminator has the ability to attach input methods to the fields that use them.  For example, date pickers or custom keyboards can be manipulated through methods on the fields that receive the value of said input methods.


### Defining Custom Input Methods

Input methods are built using:

```javascript
newInputMethod(methodName, description, isActiveFn, selector, features);
```
Note
> Input method definition is best done through the functions provided in the AppMap.  This is the low-level reference.

In the example of the year/month/day date picker input method (which is provided by Illuminator), the `isActiveFn` returns true when the picker wheels are visible, and the `selector` provides access to the window element that contains all 3 wheels.  `features` is an associative array of function names to their implementations (e.g. `pickDate`, which intelligently selects the date values).


### Using Custom Input Methods

Attaching a custom input method to a text field and using it can be done as follows:

```javascript
var myTextField = mainWindow().textFields()[0];
var myInputMethod = newInputMethod("blah", "something", myFn1, mySelector,
	                               {"someInputFunction": myFn2});

myTextField.setInputMethod(myInputMethod);
myTextField.customInputMethod().someInputFunction();
```

### Forcing an Element to Take Input

Sometimes it's necessary to "edit" an element that does not take input.  This is a common workaround for text fields within table cells that do not properly bring up the keyboard when tapped.  In these cases, the table cell can be treated as the editable element as follows:

```javascript
var myCell = mainWindow().tableViews()[0].cells()[0];
// myCell.textFields()[0].typeString("foo"); // seems like it should work, but sometimes doesn't

// workaround
myCell.useAsEditableField();
myCell.typeString("foo"); // now this function is available.

// even more complex usage
myCell.setInputMethod(myInputMethod);
myCell.customInputMethod().someInputFunction(); // now this function is available too
```

### `.typeString` for Custom Keyboards

Custom keyboards are not considered `UIAKeyboard` elements by UIAutomation, and as such do not support the `.typeString` method.  For these, the `typeStringCustomKeyboard` method is provided by Illuminator, which makes a reasonable effort to type out an input string using the available keys.  In the case of the `myInputMethod` example above, the proper usage would be:

```javascript
myTextField.typeString("abcd");
// This will throw, because myTextField's input method doesn't understand typeString

myInputMethod.features["typeString"] = typeStringCustomKeyboard;
myTextField.typeString("abcd");  // Will now succeed
```
Note
> Input method definition is best done through the functions provided in the AppMap.  This is the low-level reference.



UIAElement Method Extensions Reference
--------------------------------------

This is a function reference, not a class reference; the classes to which these functions belong will be indicated.

#### `.addPhoto(path)` - UIATarget
Add the photo at `path` to the target device.

#### `.captureImage(imageName)` - UIAElement
Capture a screenshot of just this element, using `imageName` as the name for the resultant image file.

#### `.captureImageTree(imageName)` - UIAElement
Capture a screenshot of this element and all its child elements, using `imageName` as the base name for all the resultant image files.  Each image file will include the accessor string in the filename.

#### `.checkIsEditable()` - UIAElement
Tap the element and return true if a keyboard is displayed.

#### `.clear()` - UIATextField, UIATextView
Clear the text in the text field.

#### `.clear(inputElement)` - UIAKeyboard
Clear the text in the input element intelligently; if we are able to see an effect on the value of the input element, press the delete key that number of times. Otherwise, hold the delete button for 3.7 seconds to trigger automatic clearing of the field.

#### `.connectHardwareKeyboard(connected)` - UIATarget
Set the state of the simulator's hardware keyboard to `connected`.

#### `.customInputMethod()` - UIATextField, UIATextView, UIAStaticText
Tap the element to bring up the element's custom input method, and return a reference to the input method.

#### `.elementReferenceDump(varName, visibleOnly)` - UIAElement
Logs the output of `.getChildElementReferences` to the console.

#### `.equals(element, maxRecursion)` - UIAElement
Returns `true` if this element equals `element` -- they (and all ancestors) have the same `name()`, type, `isVisible()`, and `rect()`.  Note that this function is not necessarily immune to false positives, although they are highly unlikely to exist.

#### `.find(criteria, varName)` - UIAElement
Finds any element in the tree beneath this element that matches the `criteria`.  Returns an associative array of elements, keyed off their (stringified) accessors (which will begin with `varName`).  The criteria must be an object -- the fields are as defined by [criteria selectors](Selectors.md).

For example, a valid criteria object might look like the following:

```javascript
{isVisible: true, name: "My Element", UIAType: "UIAStaticText"}
```

#### `.firstWithNameRegex(pattern)` - UIAElementArray
Same as `.firstWithName(name)` for UIAElementArray objects, but does a regular expression match on the provided `pattern`.

#### `.getCellWithPredicateByScrolling(cellPredicate)` - UIATableView
Given a valid `cellPredicate` (identical to UIAutomation's `.firstWithPredicate`), scroll through the UIATableView until a matching cell is found.  This is necessary in cases where content is dynamically loaded, because the `.name()` property is not always available for cells in table views.

#### `.getChildElement(selector)` - UIAElement
Returns the element retrieved by the given [`selector`](Selectors.md), relative to this element.

#### `.getChildElementByScrolling(elementDescription, selector)` - UIATableView
Given a valid selector (relative to `this`), scroll through the UIATableView until the [`selector`](Selectors.md) returns a non-nil element.  This is necessary in cases where UIAutomation does not think that an item in a table (like a button) has a scrollable ancestor.  `elementDescription` is used for logging purposes if the selector is unable to return a valid element.

#### `.getChildElementReferences(varName, visibleOnly)` - UIAElement
Returns an array of strings (relative to `varName` indicating the string selector of child elements.  Optionally, `visibleOnly` controls whether to traverse hidden elements.

#### `.getChildElements(criteria)` - UIAElement
Returns an associative array of UIAElements matching the `criteria` [selector](Selectors.md), keyed on the string version of that element's selector.

#### `.getOneChildElement(selector)` - UIAElement
Returns one non-nil UIAElement specified by the [`selector`](Selectors.md); throws an exception if 0 or multiple elements are returned.

#### `.iCloudSync()` - UIATarget
Trigger an iCloud sync on the target device.

#### `.isNotNil()` - UIAElement, UIAElementNil
Returns true if the element is not `UIAElementNil`.

#### `.isVisible()` - UIAElementNil
Similar to `.isVisible()` for ordinary UIAElement objects but always returns false.  Provided for compatibility.

#### `.language()` - UIATarget
Return the device language that was specified to Illuminator on startup

#### `.locale()` - UIATarget
Return the device locale that was specified to Illuminator on startup

#### `.openURL(url)` - UIATarget
Open a URL on the target device.

#### `.preProcessSelector(selector)` - UIAElement
This is a prototype function that can be overridden by an app-specific preprocessing function.  Any [`selector`](Selectors.md) that can be passed to any selector evaluation function must pass through this function first, so by overriding this function in your application you can allow new functionality or criteria to be understood.  See the [Selectors appendix](Selectors.md) for an example of this.

#### `.reduce(callback, initialValue)` - UIAElement
Applies a `callback` function to every element in the tree.  The callback must accept the following arguments:

1. `initialValue` first, then whatever was returned by the last invocation of the callback function
2. The UIAElement currently being visited
3. The string selector to the element being visited
4. The UIAElement on which `.reduce` was originally called


#### `.reduceVisible(callback, initialValue)` - UIAElement
Same as `.reduce`, but applies only to visible elements.

#### `.svtap(timeout)` - UIAElement
Attempt to `.scrollToVisible` on the element before `.vtap`ing it.

#### `.typeString(text, clear)` - UIATextField, UIATextView
If the keyboard is not visible, taps the element.  If `clear` is `true`, deletes all the text in the box.  Next, attempts to type the value of `text` on the keyboard.  Handles strange exceptions in iOS 6.x related to keys not being tappable, and other random errors related to tapping keys too quickly.

#### `.vtap(timeout)` - UIAElement
Wait `timeout` seconds for the element to become visible.  If it does, tap it; if not, throw an exception.

#### `.waitForChildExistence(timeout, existenceState, description, selector)` - UIAElement
Wait for a [`selector`](Selectors.md) called `description` from this element to return an element (or not, as defined in `existenceState`) in the given `timeout`.  If `existenceState` is `true`, a non-nil element will be returned (or an exception thrown).  If `false`, a `UIAElementNil` will be returned for success and an exception will be thrown for failure.

#### `.waitForChildSelect(timeout, selectors)` - UIAElement
Wait `timeout` seconds for any members of an associative array of [`selectors`](Selectors.md) (keyed by an arbitrary label) to return a valid element.  Elements are returned in an associative array keyed by the same arbitrary labels, or else an exception is thrown.

#### `.waitForDeviceOrientation(timeout, orientation)` - UIATarget
Wait `timeout` seconds for the orientation to equal `orientation` (e.g. `UIA_DEVICE_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT`)

#### `.waitForInterfaceOrientation(timeout, orientation)` - UIAApplication
Wait `timeout` seconds for the orientation to equal `orientation` (e.g. `UIA_DEVICE_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT`)

#### `.waitForLandscapetOrientation(timeout)` - UIAApplication, UIATarget
Wait `timeout` seconds for the interface orientation to be left or right landscape.

#### `.waitForName(timeout, name)` - UIAElement
Wait `timeout` seconds for `.name()` on this element to be equal to `name`.

#### `.waitForPortraitOrientation(timeout)` - UIAApplication, UIATarget
Wait `timeout` seconds for the interface orientation to be vertical (upside down counts).

#### `.waitForValidity(timeout, validity)` - UIAElement
Wait `timeout` seconds for `.isValid()` on this element to be equal to `validity`.

#### `.waitForVisibility(timeout, visibility)` - UIAElement
Wait `timeout` seconds for `.isVisible()` on this element to be equal to `visibility`.

#### `.withNameRegex(pattern)` - UIAElementArray
Same as `.withName(name)` for UIAElementArray objects, but does a regular expression match on the given `pattern`.


UIAHost Method Extensions Reference
-----------------------------------

The following methods are available for UIAHost objects

#### `.readFromFile(path)`
Read the contents of the host filesystem's file at `path`, and return it as a string.  Raises a helpful exception if the file cannot be read.

#### `.readJSONFromFile(path)`
Read the contents of the host filesystem's file at `path`, and parse it into a JSON object.  Raises a helpful exception if the file cannot be read, and a different exception if the file does not contain JSON.

#### `.readJSONFromPlistFile(path)`
Read the contents of the host filesystem's file at `path`, convert it from a plist file to a JSON file, and parse it into a JSON object.  Raises a helpful exception if the file cannot be read, and a different exception if the converted file does not contain JSON.

#### `.shellAsFunction(command, args, timeout)`
This is a wrapper for `performTaskWithPathArgumentsTimeout`, using identical arguments to that function.  If the shell command returns a nonzero exit code, an exception will be thrown that contains any text from the shell's STDERR.

#### `.writeToFile(path, data)`
Replace the contents of the host filesystem's file at `path` with `data`, returning a boolean of whether this operation was successful.
